In this section, we will create our first AWS CDK Application. You will learn about the structure of an AWS CDK project, how to work with the AWS Construct Library, and how to use the AWS CDK command tool.

The development workflow for AWS CDK is as follows:

  - Create the app from a template provided by the AWS CDK.
  - Add code to the app to create resources within stacks.
  - Build the app.
  - Synthesize one or more stacks in the app to create an AWS CloudFormation template.
  - Deploy one or more stacks to your AWS account.
