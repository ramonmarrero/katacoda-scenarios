In Python, statements are normally executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code multiple times.

Python provides various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.

A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.

## while loop

A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

Syntax

The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is:

```while expression:
  statement(s)```


## for loop

Syntax

```for iterating_var in sequence:
  statements(s)```

Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
