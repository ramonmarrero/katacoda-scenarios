Assignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size of the list or clear it entirely:

`letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']`{{execute}} 

`letters[2:5] = ['C', 'D', 'E']`{{execute}} 

`letters`{{execute}} 

`letters[2:5] = []`{{execute}} 

`letters`{{execute}} 

`letters[:] = []`{{execute}} 

`letters`{{execute}}
