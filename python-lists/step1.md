Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.

Open Python interpreter by executing the command below:

`python`{{execute}} 

Click or Type the commands below:

`squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`{{execute}} 

`squares`{{execute}} 

Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:

`squares[0]`{{execute}} 

`squares[-1]`{{execute}} 

`squares[-3:]`{{execute}}
