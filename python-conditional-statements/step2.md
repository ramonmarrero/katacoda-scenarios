In the form shown above:

    <expr> is an expression evaluated in Boolean context, as discussed in the section on Logical Operators in the Operators and Expressions in Python tutorial.
    <statement> is a valid Python statement, which must be indented. (You will see why very soon.)


If <expr> is true, then <statement> is executed. If <expr> is false, then <statement> is skipped over and not executed.

Important! Note that the colon (:) following <expr> is required.
