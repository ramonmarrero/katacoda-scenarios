## Else condition

The "else condition" is usually used when you have to judge one statement on the basis of other. If one condition goes wrong, then there should be another condition that should justify the statement or logic. 

Syntax

The syntax of the if Statement in Python programming language is:

```if <expr>:
 <statement>
else
 <statement>```

### Example

`x,y =8,4`{{execute}}
	
`if(x < y):
 st= "x is less than y"
else:
 st= "x is greater than y"
 print (st)`{{execute}}
