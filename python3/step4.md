The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt:

`width = 20`{{execute}} 

`height = 5 * 9`{{execute}} 

`width * height`{{execute}} 

If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:

`n`{{execute}}
