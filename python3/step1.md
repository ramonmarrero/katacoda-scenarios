The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:

Open Python interpreter by executing the command below:
`python`{{execute}} 

Click / Type the commands below:

`2 + 2`{{execute}} 

`50 - 5 * 6`{{execute}} 

`(50 - 5 * 6) / 4`{{execute}} 

`8 / 5`{{execute}} 

The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.
